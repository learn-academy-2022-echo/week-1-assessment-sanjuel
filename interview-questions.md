# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is an information tracker program that allows more than one person to work on the same code and transfer them to one another. It also allows pople to check out branches and make changes that wont affect the main branch. Github is somewhere where peopel can upload their branches and clone repositories to share their work. We often use git and Github to share our work between our cohort. 

Researched answer: git stands for Global Information Tracker, and is used to track progress between multiple computers and people at the same time. Using git you can check out branches, make changes and wreck the file with no changes to the main one. Github is a cloud sharing service, wherep eopel can upload their git repositories and share them amongst one another. It is essential for uploading and sharing work.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Operators that compare things, such as <, >, <=, >= will return a Boolean value, which is true or false. 

Researched answer: A Boolean value, which would be true or false, will be returned whenever you compare two things. An example of this would be in 4 > 3, which would come up as true, because four is greater than 3, and if you put 4 < 3 it wouold return false, because four is not less than 3. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the location on a string of a character. A value is the number of characters in a string

Researched answer: An index is the location of an element on a string, while a value is a type of data that is stored. For example, in the array [1, 4, 23, 15, 90], the number 23 has the index 2, since they start at 0, and the value of 23. Similarly, if you had a string, "Hello World!" the index of te letter o in Hello would be 4, and the value would be "o"

4. What is iteration? 

Your answer: Iteration is in a loop, whenever you have to do something multiple times to get a result. 

Researched answer: Iteration is when a process in repeated multiple times. This comes in handy when we use loops, as the goal of those is to have many processes happen without us having to repeatedly run them over and over again. An example of this would be in the loop
    const num = 1
    for(let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        return (num[i]) 
    }
The loop is repeatedly checking over and over again until it reaches 20, so that I don't have to write it 20 times to get the same result. 
5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: One person, the driver, will share their screen and do all of the coding, while listening to the navigator. The navigator is the one who tells the driver what to do, and guides them through any problems that may come up. Every 20-30 minutes the driver and navigator should push their work through github and switch roles, so that they both have a chance to fill each role. 

Researched answer: There are two people, a driver and a navigator. The driver does all of the typing, the coding, and listens to what the navigator is saying. Conversly, the navigator does none of the typing, watches the drivers screen, and tells them what to write. The navigator helps the driver through all the problems they may have. Through github, they can save and share the code they are working on to each other, and every 20-30 minutes, they will do so and switch roles. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that runs inside of another function. 

2. Jest: A javscript testing framework that allows for large programs to work with javascript. 

3. Objects: In javascript, everything that is a variable is an object. It is a piece of data that you can describe. 

4. Method: A method is an object that was assigned to a function. There are many build in methods in javascript, like .charAt

5. Classes: Classes are a way of creating objects, and keeping them in one area of your code.
